# Simple Linear Regression

This lecture is on simple linear regression (one explanatory variable and one response variable). 

Other types of regression are:
* multiple linear regression
* multivariate linear regression

**Note:** It is misleading to use term multi-variate, when you simply mean multiple linear regression

## Mathematical Knowledge Required

Mathematical knowledge required to understand linear regression includes very basic knowedge about coordinate geometry. You should know how to form equation of a straight line. Below is the general standard form of equation of a straight line: 
**y = mx + c**


## To understand code:

### Prerequisites

You should know basic python, including a little knowledge of numpy and pandas. For data visualization, some knowledge of matplotlib is also expected, although not necessary to understand the overall lecture.
