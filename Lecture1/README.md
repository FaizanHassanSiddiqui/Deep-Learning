# Simple Linear Regression

This lecture is on simple linear regression (one explanatory variable and one response variable). 

Other types of regression are:
* multiple linear regression
* multivariate linear regression

**Note:** It is misleading to use term multi-variate, when you simply mean multiple linear regression
